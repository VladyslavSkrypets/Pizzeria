# Pizzeria

The main part of the layout is in the views.js file.
It implements such features as loader, slider, receiving product data from a so-called remote server using XMLHttpRequest,
page routing (Home page, catalog, stock page, cart, product page, checkout page.)
Also, after placing an order, a POST request is sent with the order data.
The pizzeria is also fully adaptable for mobile phones.
